You will write a shuffling program. It should alternate printing lines starting at the beginning of the file moving forward and lines at the end of the file moving backwards. So, your output should alternate with lines from the beginning of the file and lines from the end. With this input:

     first
     second
     third
     fourth
     fifth
the program should produce this output:

     first
     fifth
     second
     fourth
     third
